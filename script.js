Title: Modernization of Legacy System

Date: [Insert Date]

Status: Accepted

Context: The project aims to modernize a legacy system by upgrading its technology stack and adopting modern software design principles. This involves multiple key transformations:

1. Java Upgrade: Migrating the backend from Java 1.3 to Java 17.


2. Frontend Upgrade: Upgrading the frontend from Angular 11 to Angular 18.


3. Messaging Queue Transition: Replacing IBM MQ with Apache Kafka.


4. Web Service Migration: Moving from SOAP-based services to RESTful APIs.



These changes are necessary to improve performance, maintainability, security, and scalability of the system, while also aligning with current industry standards and best practices.

Decision:

1. Java Upgrade:

Move from Java 1.3 to Java 17.

Address deprecated methods and features.

Implement modern Java constructs (e.g., lambda expressions, streams).

Replace obsolete libraries with up-to-date alternatives.



2. Angular Upgrade:

Upgrade from Angular 11 to Angular 18.

Migrate and refactor components to use the latest Angular features (e.g., standalone components).

Ensure compatibility with new Angular modules and APIs.

Update Angular Material and other third-party dependencies.



3. IBM MQ to Apache Kafka:

Replace synchronous messaging with event-driven, asynchronous messaging using Kafka.

Redesign message producers and consumers.

Implement idempotent processing where necessary to handle message duplication.

Use Kafka streams for real-time data processing.



4. SOAP to RESTful APIs:

Replace existing SOAP-based web services with RESTful endpoints.

Redesign service contracts to follow REST principles (e.g., resources, HTTP methods).

Ensure backward compatibility for any legacy consumers.




Golden Path:

The Golden Path provides a step-by-step outline for the projectâ€™s transformation journey, ensuring smooth execution and minimal disruption.

1. Assessment & Planning:

Inventory of current components.

Identify dependencies and potential breaking changes.

Develop a phased roadmap.



2. Backend Upgrade (Java 1.3 to Java 17):

Perform automated code analysis and identify incompatible features.

Refactor code incrementally while maintaining backward compatibility.

Implement unit and integration tests to validate functionality.

Optimize and leverage modern Java features (e.g., module system, records).



3. Frontend Migration (Angular 11 to Angular 18):

Upgrade Angular in incremental steps (11 -> 12 -> ... -> 18) to minimize risk.

Address breaking changes in each version.

Rewrite legacy components where required.

Test thoroughly using Angular testing frameworks.



4. Messaging System Transition (IBM MQ to Kafka):

Set up a Kafka cluster and create necessary topics.

Implement new producers and consumers using Kafka clients.

Migrate existing messages to Kafka using bridge solutions.

Monitor and optimize throughput and latency.



5. Service Migration (SOAP to RESTful APIs):

Identify existing SOAP services.

Design equivalent RESTful services with improved structure and usability.

Implement RESTful services and deprecate old SOAP endpoints gradually.

Update documentation and client libraries.



6. Testing & Validation:

Comprehensive regression testing across all components.

Performance testing to measure improvements.

Security testing to address potential vulnerabilities.



7. Deployment & Rollout:

Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated builds and deployments.

Roll out in phases, starting with non-critical components.

Perform canary releases for high-risk components.



8. Monitoring & Feedback:

Implement monitoring and alerting for all services.

Gather feedback and address any issues promptly.




Consequences:

1. Benefits:

Improved performance and scalability.

Enhanced maintainability and security.

Faster development with modern tools and frameworks.



2. Risks:

Potential for downtime during major upgrades.

Increased complexity during transition phases.

Need for comprehensive testing to avoid regressions.



3. Mitigation:

Implement feature toggles for new services.

Use parallel run strategies where feasible.

Have a rollback plan for each major release.
