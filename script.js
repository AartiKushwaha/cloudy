Technical Architecture Transformation

1. Current State Overview:

The existing system is based on a monolithic architecture using Java 1.3 and Angular 11.

Communication between components is managed using IBM MQ and SOAP-based web services.

Key limitations include tight coupling between services, high latency, and limited scalability.



2. Target State Architecture:

Transitioning to a modernized microservices-based architecture with Java 17 and Angular 18.

Replacing IBM MQ with Apache Kafka for real-time, event-driven messaging, enabling asynchronous communication and increased throughput.

Migrating from SOAP to RESTful APIs to simplify service interactions, improve performance, and support easier integrations.



3. Backend Upgrade:

Refactoring Java 1.3 services to Java 17, leveraging modern language features such as lambda expressions, streams, and improved concurrency.

Modularizing monolithic codebases into independently deployable microservices.



4. Frontend Upgrade:

Upgrading Angular 11 to Angular 18, introducing better state management and improved component modularity.

Implementing enhanced UI features and performance optimizations using the latest Angular capabilities.



5. Messaging System Transition:

Replacing synchronous message queues with Kafka’s distributed streaming platform.

Implementing Kafka Streams for real-time data processing and event sourcing patterns.



6. Service Migration:

Redesigning SOAP services into RESTful APIs to support lightweight, stateless communication.

Utilizing HTTP methods, JSON payloads, and HATEOAS principles to build intuitive and maintainable RESTful services.



7. Security Enhancements:

Implementing modern security protocols such as OAuth 2.0 and JWT for secure authentication and authorization.

Using Kafka’s built-in ACLs and encryption to protect sensitive data.



8. Cloud-Native Considerations:

Designing microservices to be containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes for better scalability and resiliency.

Incorporating CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, builds, and deployments.




This transformation will result in a more modular, scalable, and maintainable architecture, capable of supporting future business growth and technological advancements.
